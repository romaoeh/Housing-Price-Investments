## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to provide data-driven insights to my client, an investment bank, on the factors that drive home prices.

By analyzing the housing prices data, I aim to identify the most important variables that impact home prices, so that my client can make informed decisions on how to allocate investment dollars into mortgage-backed securities.

## The Data
For this analysis, the dataset was a sample of 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa that were sold between 2006 â€“ 2010.

There were 81 columns in the data set, with an approximately even distribution between categorical and numerical data.

Data originally comes from Kaggle, with a full data field description originally prepared by Dean De Cook:

## Research Questions
1. Price Determinants: 
    How does the type of home(e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) affect its selling price?
2. Neighborhood Price Variation:
    Are there any specific neighborhoods that consistently command higher home prices?
3. Home Types & Impact:
    What are the most common types of homes sold in the market? Is there a correlation between age or condition of homes and their selling prices?
4. Popular Patterns:
    Can we identify any patterns or trends in terms of home types and neighborhoods that attract the most buyers or generate the highest selling prices?

## Hypotheses
Home Prices & Key Variables
I hypothesize that the housing prices data will reveal a strong correlation between home prices and key variables such as the size of the  property, the location, the age of the property, and the overall condition of the property. 

I also expect that other variables such as the number  of bedrooms, bathrooms, and additional spaces will have a significant impact on home prices. Furthermore, I believe that analyzing the data will reveal that certain geographical regions or neighborhoods have higher home prices than others. 

I anticipate that by providing data-driven insights, my client will be able to make more informed decisions on how to allocate investment dollars into mortgage-backed securities, potentially leading to increased profits and reduced risk.

## The Process
The data analysis process begins by collecting a comprehensive dataset of housing prices, including various attributes such as location, property size, number of bedrooms, amenities, economic indicators, and demographic information. This dataset serves as the foundation for uncovering the driving factors behind home prices.

Next, exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset, for which I used Microsoft Excel. In this project, I employed a systematic approach that involved hypothesizing the data and leveraging various analytical techniques such as descriptive statistics, A/B testing with T-tests, PivotTables, and PivotCharts. This involved assessing data quality, handling missing values, and detecting outliers. Visualizations, such as scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices, were utilized to identify initial patterns and relationships within the data.

Initially, I formed hypotheses based on my understanding of the problem and the available data. These hypotheses provided a framework for exploring relationships and patterns within the dataset. For example, I hypothesized that home prices are influenced by factors such as location, property size, and economic indicators.

To gain a deeper understanding of the data, I utilized descriptive statistics. This involved calculating measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients. Descriptive statistics allowed me to summarize and analyze key characteristics of the dataset, providing insights into the central tendencies, variabilities, and relationships between variables.

Next, I employed A/B testing with T-tests to compare the means of different groups or variables in the dataset. For instance, I might have conducted a T-test to determine if there is a significant difference in home prices between houses with a certain amenity and those without it. A/B testing enabled me to evaluate the statistical significance of observed differences and make data-driven inferences.

To further explore and visualize the data, I utilized PivotTables and PivotCharts. These tools allowed me to aggregate and summarize the dataset based on different variables of interest. I could create PivotTables to analyze the average home prices across different locations or property sizes, and PivotCharts to visualize these relationships in a clear and intuitive manner.

The results of the analysis are then interpreted and communicated to the client in a clear and concise manner. Visualizations, summary statistics, and key findings are presented in a comprehensive report or presentation. The insights gained from the data analysis guide the investment bank in making strategic decisions on allocating investment dollars into mortgage-backed securities based on the identified driving factors for home prices.

Overall, this data analysis project aims to provide the client with actionable insights by uncovering the key variables that significantly impact home prices. By leveraging statistical techniques, feature selection methods, and effective communication of results, the project contributes to informed decision-making and enables the investment bank to make data-driven financial choices.
